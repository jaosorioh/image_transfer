## Image Transfer Using Soundwaves

An image is converted to black-and-white for this project. This image's pixels are processed, with one tone assigned to the white color and another to the black color. This tone is transformed into audio. The microphone is then used at the receiver to detect which sound it is and convert it back to pixels to reconstruct the original image.

The project employs object-oriented programming and both the transmitter and receiver have a user interface. A video demonstration is available at:
